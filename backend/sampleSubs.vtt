00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.587
[music]

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:09.384
There was a princess named Elizabeth 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.928
who was gonna marry a prince named Ronald. 

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:19.310
Unfortunately a large dragon flew up.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.479
It took an enormous fiery breath.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:27.110
Rooooaaaarrrrr!

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.779
Burned up all of Elizabeth's castle, 

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.448
burned up all of her clothes,

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.117
carried off Ronald for dinner. 

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.204
Elizabeth decided she had to chase that dragon. 

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.207
The only thing she could find that wasn't burnt was a paper bag. 

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.210
She put it on 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.171
and went after the dragon. 

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.922
The dragon was easy to follow 

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.677
because it left a trail of burnt forest,
horses' bones and things like that.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.346
She came all the way to a cave. 

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.766
It was a dragon's cave.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.769
She walked up to the door and knocked.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:01.853
BONG! 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.063
BONG! 

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.397
BONG!

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.398
BONG!

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.609
The dragon opened up the door. 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.527
Stuck out its enormous big nose 

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.571
and said, "GO AWAY!

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.241
I have already eaten one castle today.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.659
Come back tomorrow."

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.994
[noise]

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.872
Elizabeth said, "I have to get it. I have to get in."

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:21.831
She knocked again.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:22.832
BONG!

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.167
BONG!

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.043
BONG!

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.336
The dragon opened up a door.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.297
[sound of door opening]

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.508
Before the dragon could say anything,

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.968
Elizabeth said, "Dragon, dragon, dragon, is it true?

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:36.471
Is it true? Is it true, dragon,

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.850
that you can burn up five forests with one fiery breath?" 

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:44.562
The dragon says, "Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah." 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980
It took a deep breath.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.069
[dragon inhaling and exhaling]

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.279
Burned up five whole forests. 

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:54.614
It was an incredible fire.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:02:01.120
Elizabeth says, "Dragon, that was fantastic.
Just one more time, please."

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.581
The dragon took the deepest possible breath.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.337
[dragon inhaling and exhaling]

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.465
He burned up 100 forests.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.050
He didn't have any fire left.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.221
Elizabeth says, "Dragon, dragon, is it true? Is it true?

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:24.102
Is it true, dragon, that you can fly around
the whole wide world in just five seconds?"

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.938
The dragon says, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.941
He jumps up. He went around the whole world in five seconds.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.194
[dragon flying around]

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.112
He gets back.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:34.988
He's really tired.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.157
[sound of dragon panting]

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.367
Elizabeth says, "Oh, dra-dra-dragon, amazing.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.829
Could you do it one more time? Pleeeaaase."

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.957
The dragon says, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah." 

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:52.297
He jumps up. He goes around ... [sound effect of dragon flying]

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.508
Falls right down and goes to sleep.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:01.556
Elizabeth says very softly, "Dragon."

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.765
He doesn't move.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.978
She says louder, "Dragon."

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.354
He doesn't move at all.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.814
She lifts up the dragon's enormous ear,

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:15.445
says as loud as she can, "Dragon!!!"

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.487
The dragon doesn't move.

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:18.990
She says, "This dragon is asleep."

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.492
She goes and opens up the door of the cave.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.494
[sound of creaky cave door]

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:24.662
There is Prince Ronald.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:25.705
He looks at her.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.248
He says, "Elizabeth, Elizabeth, 

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:32.420
your hair is all dirty. Your clothes are all messed up.  

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.716
You don't have any shoes on and you smell like a dragon's ear.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:41.804
Come back and rescue me when you're dressed like a real princess."

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:45.099
Elizabeth says, "Ronald. Ronald!

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.686
Your hair is all nice. Your clothes are all pretty.

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.271
You look like a nice guy, Ronald. 

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.189
But you know what?

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.983
YOU ARE A BUM!" 

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.819
And they didn't get married after all.
